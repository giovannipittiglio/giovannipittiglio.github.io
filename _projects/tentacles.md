Navigation at a smaller scale (3-6mm lumen diameter, e.g. small bronchi), may require minimal interaction between the overall length of the endoluminal device and the surroundings (see Fig. 2). In those cases, we can naturally embed less magnetic material (due to size) and interaction with the anatomy may cause inherent loss in propelling forces. For this reason, I worked on two main aspects: embedding magnetic particles along the overall length of the tentacle (augmented magnetic content); controlling the magnetic signature (lengthwise magnetization profile) of the tentacle so that it follows the anatomy during insertion, as it reacts to the applied magnetic field. This work is described in my publications in Nature Communications Engineering1 and Soft Robotics3.
To independently actuate multiple sections of the magnetic tentacle, I investigated the use of two robotically actuated permanent magnets. I demonstrated that this control strategy can manipulate multiple independent magnetic degrees of freedom, as described in my work on IEEE Transactions on Robotics4 and is fundamental in navigating small-scale tentacles deep in the anatomy. This work has also been presented at IEEE ICRA 2023.
During these research projects I had the chance of being mentor of four master students, and helped several junior PhD students to bring forward their research. This research effort led to one best paper award from the University of Leeds and one best conference paper award at CRAS 2022. For my accomplishments in research in the UK and the USA, I received the prestigious UK Alumni Award for Science and Sustainability in the USA from the British Council.
