Navigation at a smaller scale (3-6mm lumen diameter, e.g. small bronchi), may require minimal interaction between the overall length of the endoluminal device and the surroundings (see Fig. 2). In those cases, we can naturally embed little magnetic material (due to size) and interaction with the anatomy may cause inherent loss in propelling forces. For this reason, I worked on two main aspects: embedding magnetic particles along the overall length of the tentacle (augmented magnetic content); controlling the magnetic signature (lengthwise magnetization profile) of the tentacle so that it follows the anatomy during insertion, as it reacts to the applied magnetic field. 

To independently actuate multiple sections of the magnetic tentacle, I investigated the use of two robotically actuated permanent magnets. I demonstrated that this control strategy can manipulate multiple independent magnetic degrees of freedom, which is fundamental in navigating small-scale tentacles deep in the anatomy. In the following videos, from our work on <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9911989'> IEEE Transactions on Robotics </a>, we show the results of measuring the magnetic field (on the left) and the magnetic force applied on two permanent magnets (on the right), measured using two load cells.

We have shown successful navigation in the bronchial tree, using real-time localization to inform supervised autonomy. Using pre-operative imaging, the magnetic tentacle is designed and fabricated to autonomously navigate 
inside the anatomy.
