I presented our work on collaborative magnetic actuation using two robotically-actuated permanent magnets at ICRA 2023, in London. Following, the video of my presentation, where I discuss the advantages and need for generating high intensity and dexterity magnetic fields to actuate magnetic continuum robots. The full paper can be found on <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9911989'> IEEE Xplore </a>.
