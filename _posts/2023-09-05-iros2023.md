Last week, I presented our works on magnetic continuum robots for minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment at the 
<a href='https://ieee-iros.org/'> IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 
2023(Detroit, USA) </a>.

Control of soft magnetic continuum robot (see the <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10121625'> full paper </a>).
