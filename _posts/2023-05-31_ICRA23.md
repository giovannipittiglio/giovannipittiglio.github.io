On May 31st, I presented my PhD work on collaborative magnetic actuation at ICRA 2023 in London. Using two external permanent magnets, actuated using
two serial robots, we demonstrated control of up to eight magnetic degrees of freedom. Below, the video of my live presentation.

The original paper can be found on <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9911989'>IEEE Xplore </a>. This work is part of my PhD research,
part of the project  <a href='https://giovannipittiglio.github.io/projects/tentacles/'>Endoluminal Devices Actuated with Multiple Magnets </a>.
