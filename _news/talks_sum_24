This summer I will talk about the usage of magnetic ball chains as catheters for cardiac ablation at the Hamlyn Symposium <a href='https://www.hamlynsymposium.org/programme-2024/'> 
(Wed 26th Session 2), at the workshop "Endoluminal Robots" <a href='https://www.hamlynsymposium.org/events/endoluminal-robots-a-journey-from-unmet-medical-needs-design-challenges-regulatory-bodies-and-commercial-opportunities-2nd-edition/'>,
and the ISMR workshop "The Third Holistic Forum of Medical Robotic Junior Professors" <a href='https://ismr.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/Detailed%20Program_2024.pdf/'>.

Reach out to meet if you are attending these conferences!
