I am a postdoctoral research fellow in Boston Children's Hospital - Harvard Medical School, interested in design and control of continuum robots for diagnosis and treatment of cancerous tissue or faulty organs deep in the anatomy. I conduct my research at the <a href='https://robotics.tch.harvard.edu/'>Dupont's Lab </a>.
I received my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and M.S. in Robotics and Automation from the University of Pisa, Italy. I received the M. Res. in Medical Robotics and Image Guided Intervention from Imperial College of London, UK, and Ph.D. in medical robotics from the University of Leeds, UK. 

I was awarded of the <a href='https://www.britishcouncil.us/studyuk/alumni-awards/2022-23-awardees'> Alumni Awards 2023 </a> from the British Council for Science and Sustainability in the USA, for my research on medical robots in the UK and USA.
